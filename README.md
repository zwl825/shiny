# Data Product Course Project

# This shiny app studied different linear models of the predicted varible mpg of the mtcars dataset. 

Instructions of running this shiny app

1. Go to https://zwl2016.shinyapps.io/data_product/
2. Plot shows the scatter plot of mpg data ~ wt, color is define by 1 of the 3 factor varibles ( cyl, am, gear ).
3. Show Linear Regression gives an option of showing regression line.
4. Models panel shows summary of different models.
5. Anova panel shows the analysis of variance of the models.
6. Conculsion states the final result of the study.
